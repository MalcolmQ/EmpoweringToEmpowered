                Our empowerment program serves the youth (from kindergarten to young adults in college) and women daily. We reach out to the communities in Liberia to continue to increase opportunities for the youth in the community by providing classes/courses that will further build up their skillsets. This will propel them to have better futures, to lead better lives.
